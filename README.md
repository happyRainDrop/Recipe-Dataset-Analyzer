# Recipe-Dataset-Analyzer
SHINE 2020 -- Professor Nikolaidis ICAROS lab

# Introduction
To advance robots, engineers strive to make
robots more adaptable to the kinds of real-life
environments humans often encounter. In a
kitchen environment, for example, a robot may
not have access to all the tools it would expect to
use, and it may be commanded to carry out tasks
it has never seen implemented before. Our
research aims to develop an algorithm to choose
the best available tool for a given task (ex: "cut
banana"). My role in all of this is to generate
training data from online datasets and human
feedback so the robot can learn what tools are
best for certain types of actions.

# Objective and Impact of Research
Our research will help develop robots to assist
humans in a cooking environment, where certain
tools are not available and where commands
without mention of a tool (ex: "cut the banana")
are often used by humans. Eventually, we hope
our research can be expanded to help other
robots generalize learned manipulation action
plans to new tasks and environments.

# About the files in this repo
In this repo, I have attached all the code I wrote during SHINE 2020 and all of the code's inputs and outputs, with the exception of layer1.json, which was too large to upload. You can download layer1.json from the website provided in the [recipes_dataset_link.txt](recipes_dataset_link.txt) file. 

All files are my original work. Each commit description serves as a description of the file's function and purpose.

# Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Professor Nikolaidis, my
PhD mentor Hejia Zhang, and my SHINE
partner Nikitas Klapsis for helping me in my
research journey. I also want to thank my center
mentor, Ashley, and Dr. Mills for checking in
with me and making sure I wasn't confused
about SHINE. Lastly, I would like to thank the
rest of the SHINE team and participants --
without you, none of this would have been
possible.
